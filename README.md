# VillageCraft
VillageCraft is a web-based village building and simulation game that allows users to design, place, and interact with village elements such as houses and infrastructure in a 3D environment. The project combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 3D models (GLB) to create an engaging, lightweight simulation experience that runs entirely in the browser.
